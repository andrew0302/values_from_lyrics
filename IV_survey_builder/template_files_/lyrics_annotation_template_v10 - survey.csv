debrief,,,,note,,debrief,,"Thanks for completing the survey! 
 
Our research group is interested in perceived personal values in song lyrics. Some people might have a strong preference for song lyrics, or pay more attention to them when they listen. We asked a number of questions about your song lyric preferences.

Personal values are defined as abstract concepts or beliefs. They are related to our behaviors and goals at the most abstract level, above an beyond any specific situation. According to Shalom Schwartz, there are 10 main values that all people share, and each person has their own ranking of these values. In more recent work, these are broken up further into 19 values; we used an older 10-item questionnaire. 
 
This study is helping us learn how to gather data from people about the values that they think song lyrics express. This questionnaire is based on one that was a part of the European Social Survey. However, in that version, individuals were responding about themselves and not song lyrics. We will investigate whether this questionnaire is also useful for gathering information on song lyrics.
