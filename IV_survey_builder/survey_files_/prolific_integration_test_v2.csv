This study had two purposes: Firstly, our research group is interested in how individuals perceive and understand song lyrics. We would expect that not everyone is interested in the lyrics of songs. To our knowledge, there isn't a scientifically validated method for measuring a person's general interest in song lyrics. Your responses will assist us in developing a questionnaire to help us measure this. 

In addition, we are learning how to use integrate survey platform called formR with prolific.co. This study is a small pilot that will pave the way for a number of future studies.
