In addition, journal article reviewers and researchers from accredited institutions may have access to de-identified versions of this data set. In the event that this occurs, no personally identifying information will be included with the transfered dataset. 
 

4. If desired, you will receive a digital copy of your data. You may also instruct this research team to purge your data, all or in part, at any time. 
 

5. Excerpts of the data collected in this study may appear in scientific research papers, conference presentations, public presentations, and media presentations. In the event that this occurs, no personally identifying information will be included. 
 

6. Anonymized data will be kept and maintained confidentially by researcher Andrew M. Demetriou at Delft University of Technology. Researchers working with Andrew M. Demetriou will also have access to the data. Upon conclusion of the study, de-identified data will be maintained on the Open Science Framework (osf.io). 

7. Details regarding the purposes of this study will be revealed in a debriefing description on-screen at the conclusion of this survey, so as not to bias your responses.

Our research group is interested in perceived personal values in song lyrics. Some people might have a strong preference for song lyrics, or pay more attention to them when they listen. We asked a number of questions about your song lyric preferences.

Personal values are defined as abstract concepts or beliefs. They are related to our behaviors and goals at the most abstract level, above an beyond any specific situation. According to Shalom Schwartz, there are 10 main values that all people share, and each person has their own ranking of these values. In more recent work, these are broken up further into 19 values; we used an older 10-item questionnaire. 
 
This study is helping us learn how to gather data from people about the values that they think song lyrics express. This questionnaire is based on one that was a part of the European Social Survey. However, in that version, individuals were responding about themselves and not song lyrics. We will investigate whether this questionnaire is also useful for gathering information on song lyrics.
