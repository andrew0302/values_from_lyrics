#AIM

This notebook builds the set of survey files to be used on formR.

```{r setup}
library("here")
library("data.table")
library("dplyr")
```

## Import Files

To build a survey on the formR platform, this notebook uses:

Three files:

1.  `lyrics_file`    - the full lyrics and song ID
2.  `selection_file` - whether the lyrics are usable
3.  `template_file`  - building blocks for the survey

In two folders:

1.  `primary_data`   - lyrics and selection data
2.  `template_files` - building blocks of survey

Note: the full lyrics file is not publicly available as we conducted this study in collaboration with **MusixMatch** (mxm).

```{r set_file_names}
# file names: SET THESE TO THE CURRENT FILES
lyrics_file    <- "not_simple_medium_alpha_2021_full_2_2.csv"
selection_file <- "not_simple_medium_alpha_2021_full_10w (2).csv"
template_file  <- "lyrics_annotation_template_v11 - survey.csv"

# paths with data and template
primary_data_file_path <- here("IV_survey_builder", "primary_data_")
template_file_path <- here("IV_survey_builder", "template_files_")
```

The lyrics were collected using the API of a lyrics platform: **MusixMatch** (mxm).

The song ID in the lyrics and selection files is the 'mxm ID'. 
The `lyrics_file` contains the lyrics themselves in the second column.
The `selection_file` contains the results of the screening the researchers conducted to determine if a song was usable. 
The `template_file` was developed using googlesheets and the formR platform.

```{r import_files}
# lyrics datasets
all_lyrics_dt     <- fread(here(primary_data_file_path, lyrics_file)) %>% select(mxm_id, lyrics_body)

# manual selection process
selected_dt <- fread(here(primary_data_file_path, selection_file)) %>% 
  select(mxm_id, Keep) %>% 
  # these are the four identifiers from the lyric rating process
  filter(Keep == "O" | Keep == "o" | Keep == "m" | Keep == "M" | Keep == "a" | Keep == "A")

#complete template for survey
complete_survey_dt <- fread(here(
  #template_file_path, "lyrics_annotation_template_v11 - survey.csv"))
  template_file_path, template_file))
```

## Build Template

Because we're collecting annotations for song lyrics, we're asking the same set of questions for each song lyric. So the approach is to build a template, and then replace variables in it with the details of each song resulting in a 'block' with it's own ID. 

The chunk below creates a single dataframe for the song lyrics that will be used to build the survey.

formR uses the block_id column to determine what sets of questions go together. Block ids are strings of one or more letters. So this chunk first creates a vector with block_id combinations, and then assigns them as a column to the dataframe of songs that were selected by the research team.

It then merges the song lyrics into the dataframe that contains the selection variable from the research team. Finally, it removes objects that are no longer needed.

```{r formR_variables}
#grid for block identification
#formR will use this to identify which questions are blocks that belong together
letters <- list(c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'))
blocks <- expand.grid(rep(letters, 2)) %>% .[1:nrow(selected_dt),]
blocks <- paste0(blocks$Var1, blocks$Var2)

#insert block_id into selected dt
selected_dt$block_id <- blocks

#merge into working dataframe
selected_dt <- merge(selected_dt, all_lyrics_dt, be=mxm_id)

#cleanup
rm(letters, template_file_path, primary_data_file_path, lyrics_file, selection_file, all_lyrics_dt, blocks, template_file)
```

The survey itself is essentially:

1.  a 'header': containing all elements at the start of a survey including:
    -   collection of participant ID from Prolific
    -   number of lyrics shown to participants
    -   mechanism to randomly select the lyrics
    -   consent form
    -   respondent-level questions (lyric preference intensity)
2.  a template containing the questions that will be asked of each song lyric
3.  a 'footer': containing all the elements at the end of a survey including:
    -   perceived subjectivity of the task
    -   respondent feedback for the survey
    -   a debrief explaining the purpose of the study

The chunk below takes the complete survey template, and defines the header and the footer. 
Each section is defined in the `explanations` column of the survey file. 
This column has no effect on the survey itself when used as input for formR, so I used it to define each section.

This chunk also defines a string in a cell that will be used to randomly select song lyrics for annotation, represented by a 'block' of questions: `header_dt$value[2]`.

```{r create_header_footer}
# set survey 'header' and 'footer' are the parts that stay the same
#header_dt <- complete_survey_dt %>% .[1:37]
header_dt <- complete_survey_dt[explanations == "header"]

# adjustment based on: https://groups.google.com/g/formr/c/p6xDx57r5Iw/m/THo2s2yoDAAJ
header_dt$value[2] <- 'paste0(sample(size = 5, 1:%1$s), collapse = ",")'

#footer_dt <- complete_survey_dt %>% .[57:59]
footer_dt <- complete_survey_dt[explanations == "footer"]
```

The chunk below creates the template to be used.

The protocol this notebook uses to replace items in the template is sprintf, which is reflected in the way the variables are defined.

Variables defined in the template are:

-   name: objects in the survey (e.g. questions, but also text descriptions)
-   label: what is displayed to participants (e.g. the wording of the question)
-   block order: block id used by formR to group questions together
-   showif: determines if a question is shown to participants
    -   `header_dt$value[2]` creates a vector of random numbers selected from a range
    -   `size =` determines how many items are shown to participants
    -   `showif` will display the question if the number is in the random vector

```{r create_template}
# the template is a block of questions to be applied to each song lyric
# i.e. the questions are the same, but the variables related to each stimulus change
#template_dt <- complete_survey_dt %>% .[30:48]
template_dt <- complete_survey_dt[explanations == "template"]

# set strings for substitution:

#'name' is the musixmatch song ID
template_dt$name <- gsub("4116102", "%1$s", template_dt$name)

#'label' is the actual song lyrics, which occur in two places
template_dt$label[1] <- 'Between the quotation marks below are some song lyrics. Please take a moment to read them and think about the SPEAKER the lyrics. Please remember that this SPEAKER might be a the AUTHOR themselves, or someone or something else: \n \n  "%1$s"'
template_dt$label[5] <- template_dt$label[1]

#block order is the block id used by formR to determine which questions belong in a block
#we assign them to each set of questions, that are asked of each set of lyrics
template_dt$block_order <- "%1$s"

#the showif is an id used for sampling (see header_dt$value[1] above)

#adjustment based on: https://groups.google.com/g/formr/c/p6xDx57r5Iw/m/THo2s2yoDAAJ
template_dt$showif <- 'random_vector %contains_word% "1"'

##sprinf uses the `%`, so we add a second one to escape it
template_dt$showif <- gsub("%", "%%", template_dt$showif)
##then replace 1 with a variable for replacement
template_dt$showif <- gsub("1", "%1$s", template_dt$showif)

#cleanup
rm(complete_survey_dt)
```

Because the lyrics themselves can't be made available, we create a dummy dataframe resembling the `selected_dt` dataframe we would have normally had. 

```{r}
selected_dt_test <- data.frame(
  mxm_id = "123456", 
  Keep = "O", 
  block_id = "AA", 
  lyrics_body = "
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.", 
  showif_id = "1")
```


## Survey Building Functions

The following chunk is the first of three functions that uses the `template_file` to build the survey files for formR.

The `replace lyrics` function creates a single block of questions from the template and fills in:

1.  the mxm ID for individual question / variable names
2.  the block ID for the specific song
3.  'showif' number to determine if the song will be shown


```{r replace_lyrics_function}
replace_lyrics <- function(song_id, song_lyrics, block_id, showif_id){
  #create copy of template to adjust for this specific word pair
  working_block <- template_dt
  
  #inset song id
  working_block$name <- sprintf(working_block$name, song_id)

  #insert lyrics of the song
  working_block$label[1] <- sprintf(working_block$label[1], song_lyrics)
  working_block$label[5] <- sprintf(working_block$label[5], song_lyrics)
  
  #insert block identifier
  working_block$block_order <- sprintf(working_block$block_order, block_id)
  
  #insert 'showif' ID number
  working_block$showif <- sprintf(working_block$showif, showif_id)
  
  
  #set object to return
  return(working_block)
}
```

This chunk is commented out, but can be used to test whether the above function is working.

```{r test_function}
#showif_id <- 25
#song_id <- "828136"
#song <- selected_dt[mxm_id == song_id]
#song$mxm_id
#song$lyrics_body
#song_lyrics <- song$lyrics_body
#block_id <- song$block_id

#t<- replace_lyrics(song_id, song_lyrics, block_id, showif_id)
#t$label[1]
```

The `build_blocks` function takes a row number, and retrieves the variables for substitution into each 'block' of the template from `selected_dt`.

It then calls the `replace lyrics` function to carry out the substitutions.

```{r build_blocks_function}
build_blocks <- function(selected_dt, selected_dt_row_number){
  
  # get song id
  song_id <- selected_dt[[selected_dt_row_number, 1]]
  
  # get song lyrics
  song_lyrics <- selected_dt[[selected_dt_row_number, 4]]

  # get block id
  block_id <- selected_dt[[selected_dt_row_number, 3]]
  
  # get showif id
  showif_id <- selected_dt[[selected_dt_row_number, 5]]
  
  #create question block using word pair
  block <- replace_lyrics(song_id, song_lyrics, block_id, showif_id)
}
```

The `assemble_survey` function:

1.  gets the total number of rows in `selected_dt`
2.  makes a block for each row and puts them in a large list
3.  binds the blocks in the list into one long dataframe
4.  adds the header and footer of the survey
5.  adds the total row number to the cell that creates the random vector used to select which items are shown to which participant


```{r assemble_survey}
assemble_survey <- function(selected_dt){

  # set a variable to represent row numbers
  selected_dt_row_number <- 1:nrow(selected_dt)

  # make a large list of question blocks, one for each row 
  question_block_list <- lapply(selected_dt_row_number, build_blocks, selected_dt = selected_dt)

  # blind list into one large datafame
  question_block_dt <- rbindlist(question_block_list)

  #add beginning and end of survey
  survey_dt <- rbind(header_dt, question_block_dt, footer_dt)
  
  #add total number of rows to cell that creates the random vector 
  survey_dt$value[1] <- sprintf(survey_dt$value[1], nrow(selected_dt))
  
  return(survey_dt)
}
```

Thus chunk will produce a single-lyric survey .csv file that can be uploaded to formR to get an idea what our survey looked like. 

```{r}
test_survey <- assemble_survey(selected_dt_test)
write.csv(test_survey, here("IV_survey_builder", "survey_files_", "test_survey.csv"))
```



## Split Survey Script

We experienced crashes on the formR platform when trying to run a survey with too many lines. Within the formR environment, you can have multiple individual surveys, and randomly assign participants to each.

In this first chunk, we determine the number of surveys to build:

```{r number_of_surveys}
#set number of surveys to build
n_splits = 6
```

This chunk takes `selected_dt` and randomly splits it into `n_splits` sub-tables. It then names each sub-table.

```{r split_into_subtables}
#empty list of subtables
subtables = list()

#take total number of samples, and break into n_splits 
for (offset in seq(1, n_splits)) {
subtables[[offset]] <- selected_dt[seq(offset, nrow(selected_dt), n_splits),]
}

#name each survey
names(subtables) <- paste0("survey_dt_", seq(1, n_splits, 1))

subtables <- lapply(subtables, function(subtable){
  #add 'showif' column
  subtable$showif <- seq(1:nrow(subtable)) 
  #adjust value for random selection
  return(subtable)
  })

rm(selected_dt, n_splits, offset)
```

The sub-tables are then used as individual inputs for the `assemble_survey` function. The output is a survey dataframe for each sub-table.

```{r format_surveys}
# build survey out of lyric subtables and template
formatted_surveys <- lapply(subtables, assemble_survey) %>%
  
  #format surveys
  lapply(., function (survey){
    #insert string for replacement
    survey$value[2] <- 'paste0(sample(size = 17, 1:%1$s), collapse = ",")'
  
    ##get number of rows
    #extract references to numbers
    nrow <- gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", survey$showif) %>%
      noquote() %>%       # remove quotes
      as.numeric() %>%    # make numeric
      max(na.rm=TRUE)     # extract max
  
    #replace value with number of rows
    survey$value[2] <- sprintf(survey$value[2], nrow)
  
  return(survey)
  })

# convert to individual dataframes
list2env(formatted_surveys, envir = .GlobalEnv)


#survey <- formatted_surveys[[1]]
#t <- gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", survey$showif) %>%
#    noquote() %>%
#    as.numeric() %>%
#    max(na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# cleanup
rm(template_dt, header_dt, footer_dt, subtables, 
   assemble_survey, build_blocks, replace_lyrics, 
   formatted_surveys, selected_dt_test, test_survey)
```

## Export Survey Files Function

The last function exports a .csv, given a survey dataframe.

```{r export_survey}
export_survey <- function(
    survey_dt,
    data_path = here("IV_survey_builder", "survey_files_"), 
    name = "lyrics_annotation_run1_set_"
    ){
  # convert argument to a string
  object_name <- deparse(substitute(survey_dt))
  
  # get the number of the survey
  number <- as.numeric(gsub("survey_dt_", "", object_name))
  
  #survey template folder
  file_name <- paste0(data_path, "/", name, number, ".csv")
  
  # write file
  write.csv(survey_dt, file_name, na="", row.names = FALSE)
}
```



```{r}
export_survey(survey_dt_1, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
export_survey(survey_dt_2, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
export_survey(survey_dt_3, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
export_survey(survey_dt_4, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
export_survey(survey_dt_5, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
export_survey(survey_dt_6, name = "annotation_run_1_set_")
```

To estimate the number of participants necessary to get 25 ratings per stimulus we used this notebook: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-gp0lTBTVe0lmHBJEz1K5HHg6dmNpUEE#scrollTo=wDufvH0ErcCo>
