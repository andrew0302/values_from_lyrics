#AIM 
The purpose of this notebook is to help check the accuracy of lyrics. Lyrics are drawn from the primary dataset, and then queried on google. 

This chunk creates the dataframes to be used for searching. Note that the raw lyrics file is not available. 

```{r}
# path with data
data_file_path <- here("IV_survey_builder", "primary_data_")

# note: the raw lyrics file isn't available in the repo
file_name <- "not_simple_medium_alpha_2021_full_2.csv"
selection_file <- "not_simple_medium_alpha_2021_full_10w (2).csv"

# lyric dataframes:
lyrics_dt <- fread(here(data_file_path, file_name)) %>% select(mxm_id, lyrics_body)
lyrics_ids_dt <- fread(here(data_file_path, file_name)) %>% select(artist_name, lyrics_name)

# manual selection process
selected_dt <- fread(here(data_file_path, selection_file)) %>% 
  select(mxm_id, Keep) %>% 
  # these are the four identifiers from the lyric rating process
  filter(Keep == "O" | Keep == "o" | Keep == "m" | Keep == "M" | Keep == "a" | Keep == "A")
selected_dt <- merge(selected_dt, lyrics_dt, be=mxm_id)
```

This chunk takes a row number from the dataset and queries the song on google:

```{r}
#enter row number
row_number <- 64

# artist name and lyrics name is concatenated into a string
query <- paste(lyrics_ids_dt[[eval(row_number), 1]], lyrics_ids_dt[[eval(row_number), 2]], "lyrics")

# use search string on google
search_google(query)

# print out lyrics body from the row to check against versions on google
kable(lyrics_dt[eval(row_number),])
```

To test out notebook functionality when raw lyrics are not available:

```{r}
# create dummy dataframes to use for searching:

# df with artist and song names
test_ids_df <- data.frame(
  artist_name = "Tool", 
  lyrics_name = "Lateralus")

# use lorem ipsum in place of lyrics
test_df <- data.frame(
  mxm_id = 123456, 
  lyrics_body =
    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

)
```

```{r}
# enter row number
row_number <- 1

# artist name and lyrics name is concatenated into a string
query <- paste(
  test_ids_df[[eval(row_number), 1]],
  test_ids_df[[eval(row_number), 2]], 
  "lyrics")

# use search string on google
search_google(query)

# print out lyrics body from the row to check against versions on google
kable(test_df[eval(row_number),])
```
