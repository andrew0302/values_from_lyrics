#AIM

This notebook is a first look at the responses, confirming if they're legitimate.
Prolific.co data is referenced in the notebook, but is not on Github. 

This notebook first examines the time it took participants to complete the questionnaire, using data from both Prolific and Qualtrics. Responses were closely examined when their durations were substantially longer than others, or if they had sent a message on the Prolific platform, indicating that something appeared to have gone wrong during the data collection process. 

Responses were examined qualitatively within this notebook, but also on the Prolific and Qualtrics platforms.
