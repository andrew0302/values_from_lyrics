# AIM:

The aim of this notebook is to specify Mplus models to estimate the parameters of interest in this project, with simulated data.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library("here")            # file logistics
library("tidyverse")       # data wrangling 
library("corrplot")        # visualization
library("MplusAutomation") # Mplus integration
library("boot")            # bootstrapping CIs

# ensure this script returns the same results on each run
# set.seed(42)  # the answer to life, the universe, and everything
# set.seed(666) # the number of the beast
# set.seed(667) # the neighbor of the beast
```

This function simulates multivariate normal data using a correlation matrix from prior research on psychological values, and formats it to conform with the data I expect to collect.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#import custom simulation functions:
source(here("0_functions", "big_bad_sim_function_3.3.R"))
```

## Setting and checking parameters:

Here I am checking to see that I can specify parameters when I simulate data, and estimate them correctly with my statistical models.

I estimate the parameters with multilevel structural equation models, using the `Mplusautomation` package to run Mplus software.

Parameters of interest:

1\. the random intercept SD for participants; `tau_0`, which I set to 4

2\. the random intercept SD for the items, `SD`, which I set according to the prior study

3\. the means for the 10 variables; `mu`, which I set to be 0

4\. the correlations of the 10 variables, estimated from the correlations of the item intercepts, and the correlations of the machine estimates - I compare this to the original correlation matrix used to simulate the data.

5\. the correlations between the item intercept estimates of the 10 variables, with the 10 machine latent variable estimates.

```{r}
#set parameters:
n_items    <- 360
n_ratings  <- 25
n_subj     <- 500
n_machines <- 8
n_trials   <- 10
tau_0      <- 4 # by-subject random intercept sd
tau_0_m    <- 6 # by-machine random intercept sd
#tau_1      <- rnorm(10,0,1) # by subject randomslope sd: set to vary
tau_1      <- rep(0, 10) # by subject random slope sd: set to 0
tau_1_m    <- rnorm(10,0,1) # by machine random slope sd

# these are the original means from the prior study
#mu         <- c(3.08, 4.29, 3.63, 2.59, 4.60, 3.98, 4.66, 3.92, 4.26, 4.47)
# for ease of verification, I set them all to 0
mu         <- rep(0, 10) 
# these are the SDs for each value from the prior study
SD         <- c(1.3, 1.11, 1.13, 1.11, .94, .87, .88, 1.34, 1.27, 1.13)
```

```{r}
# simulate data with above parameters

# machine outputs as rows:
sim_data <- my_sim_data_dt(
  n_items    = n_items, 
  n_ratings  = n_ratings, 
  n_subj     = n_subj, 
  n_machines = n_machines, 
  n_trials   = n_trials, 
  mu         = mu,
  SD         = SD,
  tau_0      = tau_0, 
  tau_0_m    = tau_0_m,
  tau_1      = tau_1, 
  tau_1_m    = tau_1_m,
  process    = "fixed", 
  output     = "both"
)

# formats machine outputs as columns (i.e. fixed effects)
machines_as_fixed    <- sim_data$sim_data

# the 'ground truth' of the simulated item data
item_ground_truth    <- sim_data$item_ground_truth
```

```{r}
#cleanup parameters
rm(tau_1, tau_1_m, tau_0, tau_0_m, n_items, n_machines, n_ratings, n_trials, n_subj)

# cleanup functions
rm(item_ground_truth_sim_function_dt, machine_sim_function_dt, 
machines_as_fixed_function_dt, machines_as_subjects_function_dt, subject_sim_function_dt, 
my_sim_data_dt)
```

## Estimate model and extract parameter estimates

```{r}
#formatting data to pass it to Mplus:

# original variable order:
# variable_order <- colnames(machines_as_fixed)
#  "y_power", "y_security", "y_conformity", "y_tradition", "y_benevolence", "y_universalism", "y_self_direction", "y_stimulation", "y_hedonism", "y_achievement")

#renaming:
colnames(machines_as_fixed) <- c(
  #item and participant ID variables 
  "subject_ID", "item_ID", 
  
  #participant ratings
  "y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5", "y6", "y7", "y8", "y9", "y10", 
  
  # machine ratings, n_machines per value
  # there are n_machines per value
  paste0("z", as.character(seq(length(colnames(machines_as_fixed))-12))))

machines_as_fixed <- as.data.frame(machines_as_fixed)
```

I now run a series of Mplus models. Because the parameters are all estimated at the same time, I run different models to estimate different parameters.

The first model aims to examine the parameters of the participant ratings.

```{r}
#this model estimates the participant parameters, including the correlation of the item intercepts
mplus_model <- mplusObject(
  TITLE = "model;",
  MISSING = ".;",
  # select only participant variables
  VARIABLE = "
  USEVARIABLES = item_ID subject_ID y1-y10;
  CLUSTER = item_ID subject_ID;",
  
  # the only estimator available is Bayes

  # FBITERATIONS: number of iterations for each MCMC chain
  ANALYSIS = "

  SAVEDATA = "FILE IS fscores.dat;
              Save = fscores(100 10);",
  
  rdata = machines_as_fixed
)

fit <- mplusModeler(mplus_model, modelout = "mplus_files/sim.inp", run=TRUE)
fit$results$errors
fit$results$warnings

rm(mplus_model)
```


```{r}
fit |>
 saveRDS(here("III_simulation_study", "intermediary_data", "mplus_model_participant_effects.RDS"))
```

```{r}
# import custom descriptives functions
source(here('0_functions', 'mplus_descriptives_function_1.4.R'))
```

```{r}
random_effects_df <- assemble_ci_dfs(fit)
random_effects_df$SD <- SD
```

The red dotted line is the number specified when I simulated the data. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals are shown for the participant ratings below. The bootstrapping procedure may not be ideal, but in general the confidence interval captures the ground truth SD.

```{r}
random_effects_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=model, y=SUBJECT_ID, color=model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=SUBJECT_ID_lower, ymax=SUBJECT_ID_upper)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4, linetype = 'dotted',color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), n.breaks = 10) +
  ggtitle("subject random effect SD by value")
```

The red 'x' indicates the ground truth values for the item intercept SDs specified when the data was simulated. Generally, the 95% confidence intervals capture the ground truth item SDs.

```{r}
# estimating item_intercept SD from mplus fscores output
random_effects_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=model, y=ITEM_ID, color=model)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=ITEM_ID_lower, ymax=ITEM_ID_upper)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(x=model, y=SD, color = "red"), shape = 4, size=4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  ggtitle("item random effect SD by value")

rm(random_effects_df)
```

## Means of variables

The means of the values were all set to 0. Here I look at two model estimates of the means: firstly the Mplus output means and 95% confidence interval, and the means estimated from the mplus output file with the individual factor scores.

```{r}
# retrieve item intercepts from mplus model fscores output:
item_intercepts <- get_random_intercepts_mplus(fit, intercept = 'item_ID')

# compute mean of item intercepts
# in simulated data these were set to 0
item_intercept_summary_df <-  item_intercepts |>
  select(starts_with("y_")) |>
  colMeans() |>
  t() |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  t() |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  rownames_to_column() |>
  rename('mean' = 'V1', 'values' = 'rowname') 
```

The point estimate and confidence interval is taken directly from the 'results' in the mplus output. The red 'x' is the estimated mean from the fscores output file. The confidence intervals generally capture the 0, and are not statistically significantly different from 0.

```{r}
#original values order
#values <- c("y_power", "y_security", "y_conformity", "y_tradition", "y_benevolence", "y_universalism", "y_self_direction", "y_stimulation", "y_hedonism", "y_achievement")

# retrieve mean item intercept by value from model output
model_output_means <- fit$results$parameters$unstandardized |>
  filter(BetweenWithin == "Between ITEM_ID") |>
  filter(paramHeader == "Means") |>
  select(-paramHeader, -sig, -BetweenWithin)

#model_output_means$values <- values
model_output_means$values <- c("y_power", "y_security", "y_conformity", "y_tradition", "y_benevolence", "y_universalism", "y_self_direction", "y_stimulation", "y_hedonism", "y_achievement")
#merge(model_output_means, item_intercepts, by=values)

model_output_means |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = values, y= est, color = values)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower_2.5ci, ymax=upper_2.5ci)) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dotted', color = 'red') +
    # plot the means extracted from the fscores file as a red 'x' (item_intercepts_summary_df)
    geom_point(data = item_intercept_summary_df, aes(x=values, y=mean, color = "red"), shape = 4, size = 4) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
    ggtitle("item intercept mean by value")
```

```{r}
rm(model_output_means, variable_order, item_intercept_summary_df, assemble_ci_dfs, bootstrap_SD_list, ci_list_item_to_row, format_ci_df, get_random_intercepts_mplus, samplesd)
```

## Correlations of values

This is the original correlation matrix, that we're trying to retrieve:

Correlation matrix taken from SVS correlations (upper triangle) in the appendix: ![appendix_table](screenshots/appendix,%20Schwartz%202001.png){width="489"}

```{r}
og_correlation_matrix <- as.data.frame(rbind(
    c(   1,  .04, -.04, -.20, -.32, -.48,  -.11,  .01,  .09,   .50), #power
    c( .04,    1,  .25,  .08,  .01, -.30,  -.34, -.35, -.12,  -.11), #security
    c(-.04,  .25,    1,  .35,  .15, -.19,  -.41, -.31, -.32,  -.18), #conformity
    c(-.20,  .08,  .35,    1,  .12, -.07,  -.31, -.19, -.42,  -.38), #tradition
    c(-.32,  .01,  .15,  .12,    1, -.08,  -.20, -.25, -.26,  -.25), #benevolence
    c(-.48, -.30, -.19, -.07, -.08,    1,   .12, -.02, -.01,  -.39), #universalism
    c(-.11, -.34, -.41, -.31, -.20,  .12,     1,  .22,  .19,   .13), #self-direction
    c( .01, -.35, -.31, -.19, -.25, -.02,   .22,    1,  .29,   .02), #stimulation
    c( .09, -.12, -.32, -.42, -.26, -.01,   .19,  .29,    1,   .12), #hedonism
    c( .50, -.11, -.18, -.38, -.25, -.39,   .13,  .02,  .12,     1) #achievement
))

values <- c("power", "security", "conformity", "tradition", "benevolence", "universalism", "self_direction", "stimulation", "hedonism", "achievement")

colnames(og_correlation_matrix) <- values
rownames(og_correlation_matrix) <- values
```

This matrix shows the correlations between the item intercepts taken from the factor scores output file, and the ground truth. We can see the very high correlations on the diagnoal.

```{r}
item_ids <- item_intercepts$ITEM_ID

# reconstitute original item IDs
for(i in 1:length(item_ids)){
 item_intercepts$item_ID_r[i] <- paste0("2", str_pad(i, 4, pad='0')) 
}

# merge two dataframes
correlation_dt <- merge(item_intercepts, item_ground_truth, by.x = 'item_ID_r', by.y = 'item_ID') |>
  select(-ITEM_ID)

# plot correlation matrix between two sets of variables
cor(correlation_dt[,2:11], correlation_dt[,12:21]) |> 
  corrplot(
    method = "color", 
    type = "full", 
    addCoef.col = "black", 
    number.cex = 0.75)
```

Here I compare the correlation matrices between the original correlation matrix, and the item intercepts taken from the fscores output file.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

correlation_dt[, 2:11] |>
  # correlation matrix estimated from item intercepts
  select(
      y_power, y_security, y_conformity, 
      y_tradition, y_benevolence, y_universalism, 
      y_self_direction, y_stimulation, y_hedonism, y_achievement) |>
  cor() |>
  corrplot(
    method = "color", 
    type = "full", 
    addCoef.col = "black", 
    number.cex = 0.50)

  # original correlation matrix
  corrplot(
    method = "color", 
    type = "full", 
    addCoef.col = "black", 
    number.cex = 0.50)
```

Here I compare the model output correlations, to the correlations estimated from the factor scores output, and to the original correlation matrix.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))

corr_mat <- build_mplus_correlation_matrix(fit)

# correlation matrix from estimated model

```

```{r}
rm(item_intercepts, item_ids, i, values, item_intercepts, correlations, correlation_dt, corr_mat)

rm(assemble_ci_dfs, bootstrap_SD_list, build_correlation_matrix, ci_list_item_to_row, format_ci_df, get_random_intercepts_mplus, samplesd)
```

Here I estimate an Mplus model to examine the correlations estimated from the machine fixed effects.

The machine correlations should be very similar to the item intercepts.

```{r}
item_machine_correlations <- fit$results$parameters$stdyx.standardized |>
  filter(grepl('.WITH', paramHeader)) |>
  select(paramHeader, param, est)  |>
  filter(grepl('M', paramHeader)) |>
  filter(grepl('Y', param))

item_machine_correlations
```

In case it's interesting to see how strongly individual machine estimates correlate with the item intercepts, I estimate a model where I correlate the individual machine fixed effects with the relevant item intercept.

```{r}
#this model estimates the correlations between individual machines and human ratings
