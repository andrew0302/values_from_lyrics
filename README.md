# Towards Automated Estimation of Psychological Values from Song Lyrics

The aim of this project is to propose a protocol for collecting and evaluating annotations of psychological values for lyric text, which will then be compared to the output of NLP systems. 

This repository will function first as part of the pre-registration of the main study on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/h87mz/), and later as part of the completed project prior to submission for publication.  

## reproducibility

For R version control, we used [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 
Type `renv::restore()` to restore environment. 

For python version control, we exported requirements: see `IX_participant_estimation_conda_pip_requirements.txt`.
