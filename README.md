# values_from_lyrics

In this project, we develop a procedure for ground-truthing a personal values extractor for lyric text. 

It will function first as the pre-registration repository, and later as the completed project repository for its eventual submission. The pre-registration will be located o the open science framework. 




## reproducibility

For R version control, we used renv: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

Type `renv::restore()` to restore environment. 

For python version control, we exported requirements in a file called `IX_participant_estimation_conda_pip_requirements.txt`.
